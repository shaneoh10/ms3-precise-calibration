# Website for Precise Calibration

## Code Institute Milestone Project 3 : Data Centric Development

Precise Calibration is a fictional company that provides calibration services for process instrumentation equipment. 
Some examples of this equipment would be pressure or temperature sensors in a pharmaceutical plant or oil refinery 
that require regular routine calibration for reasons of regulatory compliance. The website will feature a landing page
with information about the company and its services with the goal of acquiring new customers. It will also contain a 
secure application for employees where they will be able to log in and keep track of work that is due for completion
to ensure jobs are completed on time. This application will allow employees to make use of a database and CRUD operations 
to keep the calibration management system up to date.

### Strategy

The website for precise calibration will be designed with two sets of users in mind. First there are the potential customers of the
services that precise calibration have to offer. These potential customers will be interested in viewing what services can be 
provided and how it may benefit them from a business perspective. Potential customers may be owners of a small business or they
may be managers or supervisors in a larger business that requires regular routine instrument calibration services. The landing 
page be easy to navigate and will have a professional feel to it with all information clearly presented so as not to cause any
confusion to potential customers.

The other set of users are the employees of precise calibration. Each employee will register their own personal login credentials
to gain access to the calibration management application on the website. The purpose of this application is to reduce time filling
out paperwork and sending emails as all information will be automatically updated to the database where a supervisor will be able 
to view the completed work and close out tasks. This application will contain a list of all instruments that are due for calibration
and some information regarding the instrument (due date, tag id, location, instrument type). When an instrument has been calibrated
employees will be able to mark the job as complete and if it has passed or failed and this information is then updated on the 
database. All information regarding instruments (due-date, location, tag-id etc.) needs to be clearly displayed and all buttons for
CRUD functionality will need to be clearly labelled. At no point when using the application should employees feel confused or lost
as this could lead to user input errors which would affect the efficiency of the application. 

The website will be designed for both mobile and desktop but will be targeted more towards desktop / laptop users as they are the
norm in a professional setting and it is much easier to read and input information on a larger screen.
